Introduction
------------

``yeti`` is:

    #. A lightweight library that makes it easy for biologists and 
       computational biologists to manipulate genomic information using
       familiar tools and idioms.
       
       To this end, ``yeti`` defines simple APIs that serve as a
       bridge between the rich scientific environment of the SciPy stack,
       and a fair chunk of the variety of file formats that encode genomics
       data (e.g. BAM, Wiggle, bedGraph, BED, BigBed, GTF2, GFF3, PSL, et c).

    #. A set of scripts, built upon this library, that implement common
       sequencing workflows end-to-end. Biologists can use these scripts
       directly on their aligned sequencing data, without much preprocessing
       and certainly without neeing to delve into the APIs described above.
