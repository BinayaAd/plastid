`DESeq`_
    A rigorous statistical model for differential gene expression,
    useful for RNA-seq, :term:`ribosome profiling`, and many other
    types of :term:`high-throughput sequencing` data. `DESeq`_
    can be used to test for significant differences in expression
    counts obtained using the :mod:`~yeti.bin.cs` or
    :mod:`~yeti.bin.counts_in_region` scripts.

`cufflinks`_
    A software suite for transcript assembly and differential expression
    analysis of RNA-seq data.

`Samtools`_
    Manipulate read alignments in SAM and `BAM`_ files on the command line

`bedtools`_
    Manipulate continuous (unspliced) genomic regions, and count read
    coverage for those regions
