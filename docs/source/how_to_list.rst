	- Gene expression analysis
		- Setup 
		- Calculating numbers
		- Translation efficiency
		- Differential expression
	
	- Ribosome profiling
		- P-site offsets
		- Phasing analysis
		- Metagene analyses
		- Getting vectors of counts

	- Calculate translation efficiencies

	- Filter reads by size during or before analysis
	
	- Determine P-site offsets for ribosome profiling data
	
	- Design custom metagene analyses
	
	- Find features overlapping a region of interest in the genome
	
	- Set up a new genome for use with ``yeti``
