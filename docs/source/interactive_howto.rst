Walkthroughs
=============
To faciltate exploratory data analysis, :py:data:`yeti` provides a number
of data structures useful for interactive use. A preliminary view of the more
useful ones can be found in the :doc:`tour </tour>`, as well as in the 
examples below.


Examples
--------

	- Filter reads by size during or before analysis
	
	- Determine P-site offsets for ribosome profiling data
	
	- Design custom metagene analyses
	
	- Find features overlapping a region of interest in the genome
	
	- Set up a new genome for use with ``yeti``
