Examples
========

Examples on this page serve two purposes:

 #. To show users how to do various analyses they are likely to want

 #. To use those examples as opportunities to describe how the library works


If you wish to reproduce these examples or demo other analyses, we encourage
you to download the :doc:`test_dataset` that we use.
